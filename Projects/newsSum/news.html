<h2><a name="1">PyCA cryptography 2.5 released</a></h2>
<pre>b'PyCA cryptography 2.5 has been released to PyPI. cryptography includes both\nhigh level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic\nalgorithms such as symmetric ciphers, asymmetric algorithms, message\ndigests, X509, key derivation functions, and much more. We support Python\n2.7, Python 3.4+, and PyPy.\n\nChangelog (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/changelog/#v2-5):\n\n* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: U-label strings were deprecated in version 2.1,\nbut this version removes the default idna dependency as well. If you still\nneed this deprecated path please install cryptography with the idna extra:\npip install cryptography[idna].\n* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: The minimum supported PyPy version is now 5.4.\n* Numerous classes and functions have been updated to allow bytes-like\ntypes for keying material and passwords, including symmetric algorithms,\nAEAD ciphers, KDFs, loading asymmetric keys, and one time password classes.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and manylinux1 wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL\n1.1.1a.\n* Added support for SHA512_224 and SHA512_256 when using OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n* Added support for SHA3_224, SHA3_256, SHA3_384, and SHA3_512 when using\nOpenSSL 1.1.1.\n* Added support for X448 key exchange when using OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n* Added support for SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 when using OpenSSL 1.1.1.\n* Added initial support for parsing PKCS12 files with\nload_key_and_certificates().\n* Added support for IssuingDistributionPoint.\n* Added rfc4514_string() method to x509.Name,\nx509.RelativeDistinguishedName, and x509.NameAttribute to format the name\nor component an RFC 4514 Distinguished Name string.\n* Added from_encoded_point(), which immediately checks if the point is on\nthe curve and supports compressed points. Deprecated the previous method\nfrom_encoded_point().\n* Added signature_hash_algorithm to OCSPResponse.\n* Updated X25519 key exchange support to allow additional serialization\nmethods. Calling public_bytes() with no arguments has been deprecated.\n* Added support for encoding compressed and uncompressed points via\npublic_bytes(). Deprecated the previous method encode_point().\n\n-Paul Kehrer (reaperhulk)\n\n'</pre>
<h2><a name="2">ANN: psutil 5.5.0 released</a></h2>
<pre>b"Hello all,\nI'm glad to announce the release of psutil 5.5.0:\nhttps://github.com/giampaolo/psutil\n\nAbout\n=====\n\npsutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for\nretrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU,\nmemory, disks, network) in Python. It is useful mainly for system\nmonitoring, profiling and limiting process resources and management of\nrunning processes. It implements many functionalities offered by command\nline tools such as: ps, top, lsof, netstat, ifconfig, who, df, kill, free,\nnice, ionice, iostat, iotop, uptime, pidof, tty, taskset, pmap. It\ncurrently supports Linux, Windows, macOS, Sun Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,\nNetBSD and AIX, both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, with Python versions\nfrom 2.6 to 3.6. PyPy is also known to work.\n\nWhat's new\n==========\n\n2019-0-23\n\n**Enhancements**\n\n- #1350: [FreeBSD] added support for sensors_temperatures().  (patch by Alex\n  Manuskin)\n- #1352: [FreeBSD] added support for CPU frequency.  (patch by Alex\nManuskin)\n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n- #1111: Process.oneshot() is now thread safe.\n- #1354: [Linux] disk_io_counters() fails on Linux kernel 4.18+.\n- #1357: [Linux] Process' memory_maps() and io_counters() method are no\nlonger\n  exposed if not supported by the kernel.\n- #1368: [Windows] fix psutil.Process().ionice(...) mismatch.  (patch by\n  EccoTheFlintstone)\n- #1370: [Windows] improper usage of CloseHandle() may lead to override the\n  original error code when raising an exception.\n- #1373: incorrect handling of cache in Process.oneshot() context causes\n  Process instances to return incorrect results.\n- #1376: [Windows] OpenProcess() now uses PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION\n  access rights wherever possible, resulting in less AccessDenied exceptions\n  being thrown for system processes.\n- #1376: [Windows] check if variable is NULL before free()ing it.

<h2><a name="3">ANN: gcc-python-plugin 0.17</a></h2>
<pre>b'gcc-python-plugin is a plugin for GCC 4.6 onwards which embeds the\nCPython interpreter within GCC, allowing you to write new compiler\nwarnings in Python, generate code visualizations, etc.\n\nThis release adds support for gcc 9 (along with continued support for\ngcc 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5, 6, 7, and 8).\n\nUnfortunately, the reference-count checker no longer works for gcc 7\nonwards, so it is disabled when embedded in those builds of gcc.\n\nAdditionally, this release contains the following improvements:\n\n* the plugin can now be built in a separate build directory from the\n  source directory (thanks to Tom de Vries)\n\n* gcc-with-cpychecker gained a --cpychecker-verbose option\n\nTarball releases are available at:\n  https://github.com/davidmalcolm/gcc-python-plugin/releases\n\nPrebuilt-documentation can be seen at:\n  http://gcc-python-plugin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html\n\nThe plugin is Free Software, licensed under the GPLv3 or later.\n\nEnjoy!\nDave Malcolm\n\n\n'</pre>
<h2><a name="4">ANN: A new version (0.4.4) of python-gnupg has been released. It contains a security-related change - please update to this version</a></h2>
<pre>b'A new version of the Python module which wraps GnuPG has been released.\nWhat Changed?=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DThis is an enhancement =\nand security-fix release, and all users are stronglyencouraged to upgrade.\nBrief summary:\n* Fixed #108: Changed how any return value from the on_data callable is=C2=\n=A0 processed. In earlier versions, the return value was ignored. In this v=\nersion,=C2=A0 if the return value is False, the data received from gpg is n=\not=C2=A0 buffered. Otherwise (if the value is None or True, for example), t=\nhe=C2=A0 data is buffered as normal. This functionality can be used to do y=\nour own=C2=A0 buffering, or to prevent buffering altogether.\n=C2=A0 The on_data callable is also called once with an empty byte-string t=\no=C2=A0 signal the end of data from gpg.\n* Fixed #97: Added an additional attribute check_fingerprint_collisions to=\n=C2=A0 GPG instances, which defaults to False. It seems that gpg is happy=\n=C2=A0 to have duplicate keys and fingerprints in a keyring, so we can\'t be=\n too=C2=A0 strict. A user can set this attribute of an instance to True to =\ntrigger a=C2=A0 check for collisions.\n* Fixed #111: With GnuPG 2.2.7 or later, provide the fingerprint of a signi=\nng=C2=A0 key for a failed signature verification, if available.\n* Fixed #21: For verification where multiple signatures are involved, a=C2=\n=A0 mapping of signature_ids to fingerprint, keyid, username, creation date=\n,=C2=A0 creation timestamp and expiry timestamp is provided.\n* Added a check to disallow certain control characters (\'\\r\', \'\\n\', NUL) in=\n=C2=A0 passphrases. This fix mitigates against CVE-2019-6690.\nThis release [2] has been signed with my code signing key:\nVinay Sajip (CODE SIGNING KEY) <vinay_sajip at yahoo.co.uk>Fingerprint: CA7=\n4 9061 914E AC13 8E66 EADB 9147 B477 339A 9B86\nRecent changes to PyPI don\'t show the GPG signature with the download links=\n.An alternative download source where the signatures are available is the p=\nroject\'sown downloads page [5].\nWhat Does It Do?=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DThe gnupg m=\nodule allows Python programs to make use of thefunctionality provided by th=\ne Gnu Privacy Guard (abbreviated GPG orGnuPG). Using this module, Python pr=\nograms can encrypt and decryptdata, digitally sign documents and verify dig=\nital signatures, manage(generate, list and delete) encryption keys, using p=\nroven Public KeyInfrastructure (PKI) encryption technology based on OpenPGP=\n.\nThis module is expected to be used with Python versions >=3D 2.4, as itmake=\ns use of the subprocess module which appeared in that version ofPython. Thi=\ns module is a newer version derived from earlier work byAndrew Kuchling, Ri=\nchard Jones and Steve Traugott.\nA test suite using unittest is included with the source distribution.\nSimple usage:\n>>> import gnupg>>> gpg =3D gnupg.GPG(gnupghome=3D\'/path/to/keyring/directo=\nry\')>>> gpg.list_keys()\n[{...\'fingerprint\': \'F819EE7705497D73E3CCEE65197D5DAC68F1AAB2\',\'keyid\': \'19=\n7D5DAC68F1AAB2\',\'length\': \'1024\',\'type\': \'pub\',\'uids\': [\'\', \'Gary Gross (A =\ntest user) <gary.gr... at gamma.com>\']},{...\'fingerprint\': \'37F24DD4B918CC2=\n64D4F31D60C5FEFA7A921FC4A\',\'keyid\': \'0C5FEFA7A921FC4A\',\'length\': \'1024\',...=\n\'uids\': [\'\', \'Danny Davis (A test user) <danny.da... at delta.com>\']}]>>> e=\nncrypted =3D gpg.encrypt("Hello, world!", [\'0C5FEFA7A921FC4A\'])>>> str(encr=\nypted)\n\'-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux)\\n\\nhQIOA/6N=\nHMDTXUwcEAf.-----END PGP MESSAGE-----\\n\'>>> decrypted =3D gpg.decrypt(str(e=\nncrypted), passphrase=3D\'secret\')>>> str(decrypted)\n\'Hello, world!\'>>> signed =3D gpg.sign("Goodbye, world!", passphrase=3D\'sec=\nret\')>>> verified =3D gpg.verify(str(signed))>>> print "Verified" if verifi=\ned else "Not verified"\n\'Verified\'\nAs always, your feedback is most welcome (especially bug reports [3],patche=\ns and suggestions for improvement, or any other points via themailing list/=\ndiscussion group [4]).\nEnjoy!\nCheers\nVinay SajipRed Dove Consultants Ltd.\n[1] https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/python-gnupg[2] https://pypi.python.o=\nrg/pypi/python-gnupg/0.4.4[3] https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/python-gnup=\ng/issues[4] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-gnupg[5] https:/=\n/bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/python-gnupg/downloads/\n\n'</pre>

<h2><a name="7">EPS: Announcing the Guido van Rossum Core Developer Grant</a></h2>
<pre>b'At the last General Assembly of the EuroPython Society (EPS) at\nEuroPython 2018 in Edinburgh, we voted on a new grant program we want\nto put in place for future EuroPython conferences.\n\nWe all love Python and this is one of the main reasons we are putting\non EuroPython year after year, serving the "cast of thousands" which\nsupport Python. But we also believe it is important to give something\nback to the main team of developers who have contributed lots of their\ntime and energy to make Python happen: the Python Core Developers.\n\nThis group is small, works countless hours, often in their free time\nand often close to burnout due to not enough new core developers\njoining the team.\n\nFree Tickets for Python Core Developers\n---------------------------------------\n\nTo help with growing the team, putting it more into the spotlight and\ngive them a place to meet, demonstrate their work and a stage to\ninvite new developers, we decided to give Python Core Developers free\nentry to future EuroPython conferences, starting with EuroPython 2019\nin Basel, Switzerland\n\nIn recognition of Guido\x92s almost 20 years of leading this team, and\nwith his permission, we have named the grant \x93Guido van Rossum Core\nDeveloper Grant\x94.\n\nDetails of the grant program are available on our core grant page:\n\nhttps://www.europython-society.org/core-grant\n\nPS: If you are a core developer and want to organize a workshop,\nlanguage summit or similar event at EuroPython 2019, please get in\ntouch with our program workgroup (program@europython.eu) soon, so that\nwe can arrange rooms, slots, etc.\n\nPPS: If you want to become a core developer, please have a look at the\nPython Dev Guide:\n\n    https://devguide.python.org/coredev/\n\n\n\nHelp spread the word\n--------------------\n\nPlease help us spread this message by sharing it on your social\nnetworks as widely as possible.

<h2><a name="8">NumPy 1.16.1 release</a></h2>
<pre>b'Hi All,\n\nOn behalf of the NumPy team I\'m pleased to announce the release of NumPy\n1.16.1. This release fixes bugs reported against the 1.16.0 release, and\nalso backports several enhancements from master that seem appropriate for a\nrelease series that is the last to support Python 2.7. The supported Python\nversions are 2.7 and 3.5-3.7. The wheels on PyPI are linked with OpenBLAS\nv0.3.4+,  which should fix the known threading issues found in previous\nOpenBLAS versions. Downstream developers building this release should use\nCython >= 0.29.2 and, if using OpenBLAS, OpenBLAS > v0.3.4.\n\nIf you are installing using pip, you may encounter a problem with older\ninstalled versions of NumPy that pip did not delete becoming mixed with the\ncurrent version, resulting in an *ImportError*. That problem is\nparticularly common on Debian derived distributions due to a modified pip.\nThe fix is to make sure all previous NumPy versions installed by pip have\nbeen removed. See #12736 <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12736>  for\ndiscussion of the issue. Note that previously this problem resulted in an\n*AttributeError*.\n\nWheels for this release can be downloaded from PyPI\n<https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.16.1/>, source archives and release notes\nare available from Github\n<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.16.1>.\n\n*Enhancements*\n\n* #12767: ENH: add mm->q floordiv\n* #12768: ENH: port np.core.overrides to C for speed\n* #12769: ENH: Add np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes_type(dtype), improve\n`np.ctypeslib.as_ctypes`\n* #12773: ENH: add "max difference" messages to\nnp.testing.assert_array_equal...\n* #12820: ENH: Add mm->qm divmod\n* #12890: ENH: add _dtype_ctype to namespace for freeze analysis\n\n*Contributors*\n\nA total of 16 people contributed to this release.  People with a "+" by\ntheir\nnames contributed a patch for the first time.\n\n* Antoine Pitrou\n* Arcesio Castaneda Medina +\n* Charles Harris\n* Chris Markiewicz +\n* Christoph Gohlke\n* Christopher J.
